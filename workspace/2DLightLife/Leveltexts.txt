Her name was Snow, that was all she remembered. A force from her left seemed to be 
able to guide her, a second thought was that of a word, green, it was soothing she thought.

This seemed familiar but something was different, a new force on her right side was 
present and it made the emitting of more light possible. Was this newfound \"power\" 
somehow affecting the environment?
 
"The green little polygons seemed like they were drawn to Snow, "
+ "and she to them, and whenever she was close to them she felt at ease."
+ " She felt the strange urge to touch them but every time she tried everything went black,"
+ " once again she would be lost and this time there seemed to be an obstacle in the way."

"Again, so familiar but still different. " +
"Snow knew not to take her surroundings\' behavior for granted, " +
"if it looked different it could also behave differently."
